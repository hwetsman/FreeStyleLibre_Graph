# Introduction
Management of glucose levels is an increasingly imporant healthcare tool. Recent advances in continuous glucose monitoring have popularlized the use of continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) such as the Abbot FreeStyle Libre. Reading the FreeStyle Libre is managed by the user with a smart phone app or a dedicated device and data is uploaded to the user's account at [Abbott's portal](https://www.libreview.com). Users can download .csv files from the portal. This project is a start at providing an analytic tool for indidviduals to use in the privacy of their own home.

# Data
While it is not usual for a git repo to contain data, I have decided to add a data file to this repo. As not everyone who will want to work on this project will have their own libreview data, a random sample file is necessary for development.

# Meds
The Libreview portal will show the user the acute effects of short acting meds such as insulin. I'd like to offer people a way to see the effects of daily meds on glucose. I want to add the ability to enter a start date and end date for daily meds and a way to graph the regression line of average daily glucose readings for the period during which the meds are taken
